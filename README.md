# mgis.py
This snippet may help you to work with point clouds where you are working on a mostly geospatial features. That was the case for me at least.
As a newbie, I would more than love to take recommendation about how can I write better codes and also what can I add to this code script.

# convertAll.py & glbToPly.py
glbToPly.py : Contains functions that can convert .glb mesh objects to .ply point clouds files. And some extra functions.
convertAll.py : Basic usage of glbToPly where converting all the .glb files in specific folder to .ply files.  

# pcdAugmentation.py
Point Cloud Augmentation. Just resizing xyz. It's not that useful but may be helpful.
