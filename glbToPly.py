# Func List 
# glbToPcd: basically helps you to convert glb to
#               point cloud and returns o3d.geometry.PointCloud

# saveAsPly: takes your point cloud and save it as FILENAME.ply
                # it will work nested-like with glbToPcd

# convertAll: you can see the example of it  in convertAll.py
# visualize_mesh: names say it all. But takes pointclouds too.
# get_quartiles: Idea of this function is help to optimizing the number_of_points
#                but surface area is not a good param to decide number_of_points I think.
